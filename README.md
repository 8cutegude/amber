# Amber

Programming language that compiles to Bash. It's a high level programming language that makes it easy to create shell scripts. In addition to that - the main functionality works in an abstraction layer meaning that you can recompile standard library in a way so that it uses your proxy that can disable / enable certain features. It's particulary well suited for cloud services.
